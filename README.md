# "Hi! I'm my Hotel Dashboard, ready to chat with some numbers!

My Total Revenue is a whopping(means very large or impressive)$1,70,87,71,229 – lots of money! And I have 1,345,990 bookings – so many guests!
But only 57.87% of my rooms are full – sad beds! A quarter, or 24.83%, of guests cancel – that's rude!
Weekends are super busy with 78% of bookings, while weekdays are sleepy with just 20%. I have lots of space, but don't fill it all.
My revenue in May was around $57, June $51, July $48, but one blank month was only $7 – yikes!
The 'Elite' rooms make the most cash at 36% of my revenue, with 'Premium' at 29%.
I'm watching all my hotels and months closely. Time to get busy!"

# Future plans is

To make my hotels even better, I need to focus on getting more people into those empty rooms, as my 57.87% occupancy shows there's lots of space. I must try to understand why 24.83% of bookings are canceled and find ways to make guests stick with their plans. Also, I need to work on getting more people in on weekdays, since they only make up 20% of bookings compared to 78% on weekends. I'll figure out what went wrong in that really slow month where revenue dropped to around $7, so it doesn't happen again. I'll keep giving my best rooms (like 'Elite' at 36% and 'Premium' at 29% of revenue) extra care, as they bring in the most money. By doing these things, I'll see my overall success and $1.7B total revenue grow!
